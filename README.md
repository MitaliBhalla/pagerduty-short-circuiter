# Kite
`kite` is an integration of [go-pagerduty](https://github.com/PagerDuty/go-pagerduty) and [ocm-container](https://github.com/openshift/ocm-container) which lets you spawn ocm-container with automatic cluster login and other features based on the PagerDuty alert.

***Note that kite is not a reinvention of another PagerDuty CLI tool instead it is a wrapper over go-pagerduty and provides you with all go-pagerduty cli features and much more.***

## Features

- Users can select the alert, which they want to work upon, through CLI, and they will be able to quickly login to the cluster, using ocm-container, without having to copy-paste information from the alert metadata.
- Users will be provided with alert metadata in the terminal.
- Users can switch between different PagerDuty teams they're a part of.
- Users can acknowledge incidents assigned to them.
- Users can see whom the alerts have been assigned to
- Users can navigate between Tmux windows and tabs using key shortcuts
- Users can query who is oncall for each escalation.
- Users can query when are they scheduled next for oncall.
- Users can navigate between previous and next layer of oncall schedule.
- Users can view the SOP of a particular alert 
- `kite` requires zero configuration, just one-time login is required.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have [ocm-container](https://github.com/openshift/ocm-container) installed and configured locally for the cluster login functionality to work.

For further installation instructions please follow the repository [docs](https://github.com/openshift/ocm-container#readme).

## Installation
### Option 1: Download binary
1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/openshift/pagerduty-short-circuiter/releases) page.
2. Extract the package 
3. Copy `kite` to your $GOPATH/bin(or any other location on the $PATH):

### Option 2: Install binary
First clone the repository somewhere in your $PATH. A common place would be within your $GOPATH. <br>

Example:

```
$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/pagerduty-short-circuiter
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/pagerduty-short-circuiter
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/pagerduty-short-circuiter.git .
```
You need to have `go` installed, the minimum required version is `go 1.18`.

Build and copy `kite` to your $GOPATH/bin:

```
$ make install
```
### Option 3: Build from source

This command will build the PagerDuty CLI binary, named `kite`. This binary will be created in the root of your project folder.

```
$ make build
```

## Layout and Navigation
### Terminal Multiplexer

Kite is using a terminal/window multiplexing similar to `Tmux`.
The terminal multiplexer is integrated with both alerts and oncall view. A new window/terminal is refered as `slide`. The default shell is loaded when a new slide is added

### Terminal Multiplexer Navigation
The navigation related shortcuts are as follows:

| Action                                                         | Key                           | Comment                                                               |

## List of Avaialble Commands
## Login

- In order to use any PagerDuty CLI features you will have to login first.
- This tool needs zero-configuration, thus only a one-time login is required.
- In order to login, a user must have a
```
1. Valid PagerDuty API key.
2. Valid GitHub Access Token 
 ```

_**Note - For the GitHub Token, generate a `classsic` token with read-only access**_

To log into PagerDuty CLI use the command:

```
kite login
```
This will prompt the user for the PagerDuty API key and GitHub Token with necessary instructions of how to generate one. The API key and Token will be saved for future use to the `~/.config/kite/config.json` file.

The `login` command has options to overwrite the existing API key or the GitHub Token. For example, if you want to login via another user account or your API key has changed, you can login like this:

```
kite login --api-key <api-key>
```

## Teams

A user account might belong to a single or multiple pagerduty teams.

To set (or) change your kite team, use the command:

```
kite teams
```
This will list out all the teams a user is a part of and will prompt the user to select a team for kite.

## Alerts

To view the PagerDuty alerts, use the command:

```
kite alerts
```
To view the PagerDuty alerts that have been assigned to your team, use the command:

```
kite alerts --assigned-to team
```
To view the PagerDuty alerts that have been assigned to silentTest, use the command:

```
kite alerts --assigned-to silentTest
```
This will list all the alerts assigned to **self** by default.

You can modify the alerts returned with the `assigned-to` option, you can either choose to list alerts which are assigned to **self**, **team** or **silentTest**.

When viewing alerts assigned to *self*, only acknowledged incident alerts are displayed.

### Flags
```
--assigned-to          Filter alerts based on user or team (default "self") 
--columns              Specify which columns to display separated by commas without any space in between 
                       (default "incident.id,alert,cluster.name,cluster.id,status,severity")
```

### Alerts View Navigation

### View Service Logs
An alerting cluster's service logs can be viewed while viewing the alert data by pressing `L/l`.

### View SOP for the alert

To view SOP related to a particular alert, the user can run these commands:
* To select an alert and view its metadata press `enter`
* To view SOP, press `S`
This will open a the SOP in a new slide. A user needs to make sure they have access to **[ops-sop](https://github.com/openshift/ops-sop/tree/master)** repository



## Oncall

To view the current oncalls as per PagerDuty, use the command:

```
kite oncall
```
### Oncall View Navigation

By default, all the escalations and Oncalls are displayed for team **Platform-SRE** in the main view.

| Action                                                         | Key                           | Comment                                                                |

## Running Tests
The test suite uses the [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) to run comprehensive tests using Behavior-Driven Development.<br>
The mocking framework used for testing is [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock).

This command runs all the tests present within the 'tests' folder by default.

```
$ make test
```
Use the mockgen command to generate source code for a mock class given a Go source file containing interfaces to be mocked.

```
$ mockgen -source=foo.go -destination=mock/foo_mock.go
```
## List of known Bugs
There are a few bugs that have crawled up during the development. These are listed below :
- Auto completion changes moves cursor to different position but text typing continues from same position.
- Use of mouse causes random text to be typed in the terminal.
- Block cursor does not move with the text being typed (Quick Fix : Changing cursor style to line).
- When viewing an SOP, if the relative link is present for another SOP file, the new SOP might not get opened (The URL needs to be absolute for the SOP navigtaion to work).
